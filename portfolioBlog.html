###To begin with first let's understand what is html and css?

###HTML structure
 First and foremost thing you will need to make a navigation bar which will direct the person using it to the different pages mentioned in it. The active page of your portfolio will be Home where you will add your skills, link to your project page and blog page. Afterwards you will create different section with the help of unordered or ordered list and add the things you want show for example your skills, project and blog and you can also add a button for project and blog section with anchor tag and href attribute to it to direct the user to that page directly. At the bottom you will make a Footer where you can add your social media link with anchor tag and href attribute. And you are done with html part. 
Now lets move to the css directly.

###CSS Structure 
Through CSS you can do vast type of things like you can different type of colors, background-color, images, background-images, font-style, etc. 
For the portfolio first of all you will select the color theme for it. Afterwards you can add your favorite font style through google fonts or any other website by adding the link in the sheet. Last but not least you can add any images to make it more beautiful and relevant. The exciting part of CSS is that you can control every aspect of your website like width, height, size, color, shadows, and end number of things.
