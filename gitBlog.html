   <h1 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;"> Git vs. GitHub: What's the diffrence?</h1>
   <h2>Git or GitHub</h2>
<p>Are they the same/equal thing? If not, are they connected/related. The veracity is that Git and GitHub are connected far more closely than you think they're, but with some key differences setting them apart.</p>

<p>What's the difference between Git and GitHub?
    Well to know that first we will take a deep-examine at each one. But before we do that you need to know the concept of <i>version control</i>.
   </p>
<h2>So now what is Version control?</h2>
<p>Version control is <i>like a correction tape </i>for your program. It's work is to save program for your project. It tracks and logs the changes you make to your file sets over time, it gives you the power to review and even restore your earlier versions of your work. If you notice that your text is misaligned so rather than crawling back through every line of your code, you'll use the version control to reload earlier version of your code, until you find it satisfactory or correct.</p>

<p>Now let's flow directly to Git.</p>
<h2>What is Git?</h2>
<p>It was first developed back in 2005. Git is immensely popular and high-quality version of <i>control system</i>. Git is installed on your local system and keeps all the record of your ongoing program versions. you do no need any internet access to use it except if you want to download it. Git is extremely easy to use and it is not paid, hence inexpensive. It also has a branching model which allow user to make their own independent local branches, so that you can try out new ideas but without making changes in your main branch and you can anytime merge, delete and recall them.</p>

<h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
<p>GitHub is Git repository hosting service. It is entirely <i>cloud-based</i>, totally distinct from git which only allows you to control your projects in your local server/computer. GitHub is like an online storage of git , in technical words the database of projects you are working on in your local server it is being saved on the cloud in GitHub. Which allows you and any authorized person by you to see the work or contribute in that project. Like Git, GitHub also has the branching system which makes it smooth to try different approach's and distinct the work of other person from you so that it does not create any heap. You can excess your work from anywhere in the world just with connectivity of internet.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude Git is a version control system installed on your <i>local system </i>and it keep track of all your work and stores it on local device storage whereas GitHub is a solely <i>cloud-based</i></cloud-based>and a Git repository hosting service. You can push your work from local storage to cloud through internet and access the data from anywhere.</p>
